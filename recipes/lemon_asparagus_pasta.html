    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 large lemon, zested and juiced</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in
        penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally,
        for about 8 minutes. Penne will still be slightly firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir asparagus into the pot with the boiling penne pasta and bring back
        to a boil; cook until pasta is al dente and asparagus is tender-crisp
        but still bright green, about 3 more minutes. Drain pasta and asparagus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place penne and asparagus into a large bowl; lightly stir in lemon zest,
        lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salt, and black pepper until
        thoroughly combined.
      </li>
    </ol>
